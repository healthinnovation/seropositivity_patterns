**Spatial patterns of arboviruses and parasitic diseases co-exposure in hard-to-reach Amazonian villages**

**Introduction**
The Amazon rainforest is characterized by diverse ecological and social conditions that favor the persistence and co-exposure to multiple infectious diseases. Understanding overlapping exposures to vector-borne and parasitic pathogens is essential to guide geographically targeted surveillance and control strategies, particularly in hard-to-reach populations where access to diagnosis and health services is limited.

**Methods**
We conducted a cross-sectional analytical study in 19 remote communities of the districts of Belén and Indiana, Loreto, Peru, as part of the Freedom From Infection project. Seroepidemiological surveys and household geolocation were combined with multiplex bead immunoassays to detect IgG antibodies against P. falciparum, P. vivax, Schistosoma spp., Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus. Spatial clustering (Getis-Ord Gi*), inequality analysis using the concentration index and network analyses (eigenvector centrality) were applied to characterize geographic heterogeneity and pathogen co-exposure structure. 

**Results**
Among 1,116 participants, seropositivity was 40.6% for ZIKV, 33.3% for CHIKV, 11.6% for Schistosoma spp., 8.7% for P. vivax, and 3.0% for P. falciparum. The most frequent co-exposure was ZIKV–CHIKV (16.9%), indicating overlapping arboviral circulation. Arboviral seropositivity was higher among males and agricultural workers, whereas Schistosoma spp. predominated in children and adolescents. A higher cumulative burden of infections was observed in households located farther from health facilities (concentration index = –0.11), suggesting geographic inequities in exposure. Spatial analysis revealed distinct clustering patterns: cold spots for Schistosoma spp. in southern Belén, malaria clusters near water bodies in Indiana, and urban/semi-urban hotspots for arboviruses. Network analysis showed a highly interconnected structure, with ZIKV (eigenvector centrality = 1.0) and CHIKV (0.99) as dominant nodes, and Schistosoma spp. and P. falciparum acting as structural bridges linking arboviral and parasitic diseases.

**Conclusion**
The study demonstrates multispecies circulation and spatially heterogeneous exposure to arboviruses, malaria, and schistosomiasis in the Peruvian Amazon. The findings show that differences in local ecological conditions and geographic access to healthcare are associated with uneven distributions of infection exposure, highlighting the need for integrated approaches. Combining serology, spatial statistics, and network analysis provides a replicable framework to inform targeted public health interventions in remote Amazonian settings.
